          Wes Montgomery was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on March 23, 1923.
          Wes was a nickname given to him based on his middle name. His full
          legal name was John Leslie Montgomery.

          While Montgomery came from a musical family, he did not learn to play
          the six string guitar until he was 20 years old and was not good at
          reading music. However, he was able to learn by ear and developed his
          playing by listening to and learning
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Christian">Charlie Christian</a> 
          recordings.

        Part of Montgomery's signature sound was the result of using his thumb
        to strum his guitar. Another aspect of his sound was the use of octaves
        in his playing.

        Montgomery's career took off when

        hired him in 1948. He soon tired of touring and returned to Indianapolis
        where he was once again discovered. This time by

        Montgomery's solo recording career only lasted 10 years but produced
        several lagendary albums, including

        Montgomery died from a heart attack on June 15, 1968 at the age of 45.
        He had just returned from an extensive tour and was at the height of his
        popularity.
